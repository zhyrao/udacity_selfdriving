####Canny Edge Detection
![Cross section Image](https://github.com/zhyrao/udacity_selfdriving/blob/master/Image/1_Splotimag.jpg?raw=true=)

    The red line in the plot above shows where I took a cross section through the image. 
    The wiggles in the blue line indicate changes in intensity along that cross section 
    through the image. Check all the boxes of the letters along this cross section, where 
    you expect to find strong edges.
